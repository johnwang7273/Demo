# Kafka Producer/Consumer basics: an Publish-subscribe messaging system
Apache Kafka is a publish-subscribe messaging system lets you send messages between processes, applications, and servers.

A Kafka cluster consists of one or more servers (Kafka brokers), which are running Kafka. Producers are processes that publish data (push messages) into Kafka topics within the broker. A consumer of topics pulls messages off a Kafka topic.
